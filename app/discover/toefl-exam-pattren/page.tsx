                    <h2>Overview of the TOEFL Exam Pattern</h2>
                    <p>The TOEFL exam is structured into four sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing, designed to assess your English language skills comprehensively. Here is what you need to know about each section for the 2024 exam:</p>
                    <h3>Reading Section</h3>
                    <p>The Reading section tests your ability to understand academic texts. It features 3 to 4 passages, each followed by 10 questions.</p>
                    <h3>Listening Section</h3>
                    <p>In the Listening section, you will encounter lectures and conversations in an academic setting. This section includes questions that gauge your ability to understand spoken English.</p>
                    <h3>Speaking Section</h3>
                    <p>The Speaking section assesses your spoken English proficiency through various tasks that mimic real-life academic interactions and discussions.</p>
                    <h3>Writing Section</h3>
                    <p>Finally, the Writing section evaluates your ability to write in English in an academic context, requiring you to complete two tasks: integrating reading and listening tasks into a written response, and an independent writing task expressing your opinion or preference.</p>
