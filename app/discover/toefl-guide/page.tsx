                    <p>In the Reading section, you&apos;ll encounter passages similar to those found in college textbooks. It&apos;s essential to practice skimming and scanning techniques and to expand your academic vocabulary.</p>
                    <h3>Strategies for the Listening Section</h3>
                    <p>The Listening section can be challenging as it requires you to make sense of various English accents and academic lectures. Taking notes and learning to identify key points can be immensely helpful.</p>
                    <h3>Tackling the Speaking Section</h3>
                    <p>For the Speaking section, practice is crucial. Record yourself answering prompts and work on speaking clearly and confidently.</p>
                    <h3>Mastering the Writing Section</h3>
                    <p>The Writing section asks you to summarize information and express your ideas coherently in writing. Being familiar with the structure of essays and practicing writing under timed conditions will aid you greatly.</p>
                    <p>Overall, thorough preparation for the TOEFL exam involves a blend of studying and practical application. Engage with English media, practice speaking with native speakers, and take full-length practice exams under timed conditions.</p>

    //                 <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
    //                 <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
    //                     Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
    //                     documentation.</p>
    //                 <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
    //                     and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
    //                 <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
    //                     guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
    //                     to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
    //                     purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
    //                 <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
    //                     you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a

    //                     the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
    //                 <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
    //                 <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
    //                     will come in handy:</p>
    //                 <ol>
    //                     <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
    //                         follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
    //                         usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
    //                     </li>
    //                     <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
    //                         properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
    //                     <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
    //                         providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
    //                     <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
    //                         design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
    //                     </li>
    //                 </ol>
    //                 <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
    //                 <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
    //                     you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
    //                 <p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p>
    //                 <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
    //                 <h4>Type properties</h4>
    //                 <p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across
    //                     letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.</p>
