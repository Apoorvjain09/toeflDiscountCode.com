        [1] A topic of increasing relevance to the conservation of marine life is bycatch—fish and other animals that are unintentionally caught in the process of fishing for a targeted population of fish. Bycatch is a common occurrence in longline fishing, which utilizes a long heavy fishing line with baited hooks placed at intervals, and in trawling, which utilizes a fishing net (trawl) that is dragged along the ocean floor or through the mid-ocean waters. Few fisheries employ gear that can catch one species to the exclusion of all others. Dolphins, whales, and turtles are frequently captured in nets set for tunas and billfishes, and seabirds and turtles are caught in longline sets. Because bycatch often goes unreported, it is difficult to accurately estimate its extent. Available data indicate that discarded biomass (organic matter from living things) amounts to 25–30 percent of official catch, or about 30 million metric tons.

        [2] The bycatch problem is particularly acute when trawl nets with small mesh sizes (smaller-than-average holes in the net material) are dragged along the bottom of the ocean in pursuit of groundfish or shrimp. Because of the small mesh size of the shrimp trawl nets, most of the fishes captured are either juveniles (young), smaller than legal size limits, or undesirable small species. Even larger mesh sizes do not prevent bycatch because once the net begins to fill with fish or shrimp, small individuals caught subsequently are trapped without ever encountering the mesh. In any case, these incidental captures are unmarketable and are usually shoveled back over the side of the vessel dead or dying.

        [3] The bycatch problem is complicated economically and ecologically. Bycatch is a liability to shrimp fishers, clogging the nets and increasing fuel costs because of increased drag (resistance) on the vessel. Sorting the catch requires time, leading to spoilage of harvested shrimp and reduced time for fishing. Ecologically, high mortality rates among juvenile fishes could contribute to population declines of recreational and commercial species. Evidence to this effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast weakfish. Because the near-shore areas where shrimp concentrate are also important nursery grounds for many fish species, shrimp trawling could have a profound impact on stock size.

        [4] Once the dead or dying bycatch is returned to the ecosystem, it is consumed by predators, detritivores (organisms that eat dead plant and animal matter), and decomposers (organisms that break down dead or decaying organic matter), which could have a positive effect on sport fish, seabird, crab, and even shrimp populations. Available evidence indicates that 40– 60 percent of the 30 metric tons of catch discarded annually by commercial fishing vessels, and even more of the noncatch waste (organisms killed but never brought to the surface), does not lie unused on the bottom of the sea. It becomes available to midwater and ocean-bottom scavengers, transferring material into their food web and making energy available to foragers (organisms that search for food) that is normally tied up in ocean-bottom, deep-ocean, midwater, and open-ocean species.

        [5] Overfishing and overdiscarding may thus contribute to a syndrome known as “fishing down of food webs,” whereby we eliminate apex (top) predators and large species while transforming the ocean into a simplified system increasingly dominated by microbes, jellyfish, ocean-bottom invertebrates, plankton, and planktivores. The strongest evidence for the fishing down phenomenon exists in global catch statistics that show alarming shifts in species composition from high-value, near-bottom species to lower-value, open-ocean species. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, the global fishing fleet doubled in size and technology advanced immeasurably. Despite increased effort and technology, total catch stabilized, but landing rates (rates at which species are caught) of the most valuable species fell by 25 percent.

        [6] Conservation organizations have condemned the obvious and extreme waste associated with bycatch. Public concern over high mortality rates of endangered marine turtles captured in shrimp trawls led to the development of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the 1980s. TEDs were incorporated into the shrimp net design with the purpose of directing turtles out of nets without unacceptably reducing shrimp catches. Marine engineers and fishers also developed shrimp net designs that incorporate bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), taking advantage of behavioral differences between shrimp and fish, or between different fishes, in order to separate fishes.

Evidence to this effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast weakfish. Because the near-shore areas where shrimp concentrate are also important nursery grounds for many fish species, shrimp trawling could have a profound impact on stock size.

        [4] Once the dead or dying bycatch is returned to the ecosystem, it is consumed by predators, detritivores (organisms that eat dead plant and animal matter), and decomposers (organisms that break down dead or decaying organic matter), which could have a positive effect on sport fish, seabird, crab, and even shrimp populations. Available evidence indicates that 40– 60 percent of the 30 metric tons of catch discarded annually by commercial fishing vessels, and even more of the noncatch waste (organisms killed but never brought to the surface), does not lie unused on the bottom of the sea. It becomes available to midwater and ocean-bottom scavengers, transferring material into their food web and making energy available to foragers (organisms that search for food) that is normally tied up in ocean-bottom, deep-ocean, midwater, and open-ocean species.

        [5] Overfishing and overdiscarding may thus contribute to a syndrome known as “fishing down of food webs,” whereby we eliminate apex (top) predators and large species while transforming the ocean into a simplified system increasingly dominated by microbes, jellyfish, ocean-bottom invertebrates, plankton, and planktivores. The strongest evidence for the fishing down phenomenon exists in global catch statistics that show alarming shifts in species composition from high-value, near-bottom species to lower-value, open-ocean species. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, the global fishing fleet doubled in size and technology advanced immeasurably. Despite increased effort and technology, total catch stabilized, but landing rates (rates at which species are caught) of the most valuable species fell by 25 percent.

        [6] Conservation organizations have condemned the obvious and extreme waste associated with bycatch. Public concern over high mortality rates of endangered marine turtles captured in shrimp trawls led to the development of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the 1980s. TEDs were incorporated into the shrimp net design with the purpose of directing turtles out of nets without unacceptably reducing shrimp catches. Marine engineers and fishers also developed shrimp net designs that incorporate bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), taking advantage of behavioral differences between shrimp and fish, or between different fishes, in order to separate fishes.

        passage: `
        [1] A topic of increasing relevance to the conservation of marine life is bycatch—fish and other animals that are unintentionally caught in the process of fishing for a targeted population of fish. Bycatch is a common occurrence in longline fishing, which utilizes a long heavy fishing line with baited hooks placed at intervals, and in trawling, which utilizes a fishing net (trawl) that is dragged along the ocean floor or through the mid-ocean waters. Few fisheries employ gear that can catch one species to the exclusion of all others. Dolphins, whales, and turtles are frequently captured in nets set for tunas and billfishes, and seabirds and turtles are caught in longline sets. Because bycatch often goes unreported, it is difficult to accurately estimate its extent. Available data indicate that discarded biomass (organic matter from living things) amounts to 25–30 percent of official catch, or about 30 million metric tons.

        [2] The bycatch problem is particularly acute when trawl nets with small mesh sizes (smaller-than-average holes in the net material) are dragged along the bottom of the ocean in pursuit of groundfish or shrimp. Because of the small mesh size of the shrimp trawl nets, most of the fishes captured are either juveniles (young), smaller than legal size limits, or undesirable small species. Even larger mesh sizes do not prevent bycatch because once the net begins to fill with fish or shrimp, small individuals caught subsequently are trapped without ever encountering the mesh. In any case, these incidental captures are unmarketable and are usually shoveled back over the side of the vessel dead or dying.

        [3] The bycatch problem is complicated economically and ecologically. Bycatch is a liability to shrimp fishers, clogging the nets and increasing fuel costs because of increased drag (resistance) on the vessel. Sorting the catch requires time, leading to spoilage of harvested shrimp and reduced time for fishing. Ecologically, high mortality rates among juvenile fishes could contribute to population declines of recreational and commercial species. Evidence to this effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast weakfish.

        passage: `
        [1] In the early twentieth century, the science of sociology found supporters in the United States and Canada partly because the cities there were growing so rapidly. It often appeared that North American cities would be unable to absorb all the newcomers arriving in such large numbers. Presociological thinkers like Frederick Law Olmsted, the founder of the movement to build parks and recreation areas in cities, and Jacob Riis, an advocate of slum reform, urged the nation’s leaders to invest in improving the urban environment, building parks and beaches, and making better housing available to all. These reform efforts were greatly aided by sociologists who conducted empirical research on the social conditions in cities. In the early twentieth century, many sociologists lived in cities like Chicago that were characterized by rapid population growth and serious social problems. It seemed logical to use empirical research to construct theories about how cities grow and change in response to major social forces as well as more controlled urban planning.

        [2] The founders of the Chicago school of sociology, Robert Park and Ernest Burgess, attempted to develop a dynamic model of the city, one that would account not only for the expansion of cities in terms of population and territory but also for the patterns of settlement and land use within cities. They identified several factors that influence the physical form of cities. As Park stated, among them are “transportation and communication, tramways and telephones, newspapers and advertising, steel construction and elevators —all things, in fact, which tend to bring about at once a greater mobility and a greater concentration of the urban populations.”

        [3] Park and Burgess based their model of urban growth on the concept of “natural areas”—that is, areas such as occupational suburbs or residential enclaves in which the population is relatively homogeneous and land is used in similar ways without deliberate planning. Park and Burgess saw urban expansion as occurring through a series of “invasions” of successive zones or areas surrounding the center of the city. For example, people from rural areas and other societies “invaded” areas where housing was inexpensive. Those areas tended to be close to the places where they worked. In turn, people who could afford better housing and the cost of commuting “invaded” areas farther from the business district.

        [4] Park and Burgess’s model has come to be known as the “concentric-zone model” (represented by the figure). Because the model was originally based on studies of Chicago, its center is labeled “Loop,” the term commonly applied to that city’s central commercial zone. Surrounding the central zone is a “zone in transition,” an area that is being invaded by business and light manufacturing. The third zone is inhabited by workers who do not want to live in the factory or business district but at the same time need to live reasonably close to where they work. The fourth or residential zone consists of upscale apartment buildings and single-family homes. And the outermost ring, outside the city limits, is the suburban or commuters’ zone; its residents live within a 30- to 60-minute ride of the central business district.

        [5] Studies by Park, Burgess, and other Chicago-school sociologists showed how new groups of immigrants tended to be concentrated in separate areas within inner-city zones, where they sometimes experienced tension with other ethnic groups that had arrived earlier. Over time, however, each group was able to adjust to life in the city and to find a place for itself in the urban economy. Eventually many of the immigrants moved to unsegregated areas in outer zones; the areas they left behind were promptly occupied by new waves of immigrants.

        [6] The Park and Burgess model of growth in zones and natural areas of the city can still be used to describe patterns of growth in cities that were built around a central business district and that continue to attract large numbers of immigrants. But this model is biased toward the commercial and industrial cities of North America, which have tended to form around business centers rather than around palaces or cathedrals, as is often the case in some other parts of the world. Moreover, it fails to account for other patterns of urbanization, such as the rapid urbanization that occurs along commercial transportation corridors and the rise of nearby satellite cities.

        [1] In the early twentieth century, the science of sociology found supporters in the United States and Canada partly because the cities there were growing so rapidly. It often appeared that North American cities would be unable to absorb all the newcomers arriving in such large numbers. Presociological thinkers like Frederick Law Olmsted, the founder of the movement to build parks and recreation areas in cities, and Jacob Riis, an advocate of slum reform, urged the nation’s leaders to invest in improving the urban environment, building parks and beaches, and making better housing available to all. These reform efforts were greatly aided by sociologists who conducted empirical research on the social conditions in cities. In the early twentieth century, many sociologists lived in cities like Chicago that were characterized by rapid population growth and serious social problems. It seemed logical to use empirical research to construct theories about how cities grow and change in response to major social forces as well as more controlled urban planning.

        [2] The founders of the Chicago school of sociology, Robert Park and Ernest Burgess, attempted to develop a dynamic model of the city, one that would account not only for the expansion of cities in terms of population and territory but also for the patterns of settlement and land use within cities. They identified several factors that influence the physical form of cities. As Park stated, among them are “transportation and communication, tramways and telephones, newspapers and advertising, steel construction and elevators —all things, in fact, which tend to bring about at once a greater mobility and a greater concentration of the urban populations.”

        [3] Park and Burgess based their model of urban growth on the concept of “natural areas”—that is, areas such as occupational suburbs or residential enclaves in which the population is relatively homogeneous and land is used in similar ways without deliberate planning. Park and Burgess saw urban expansion as occurring through a series of “invasions” of successive zones or areas surrounding the center of the city. For example, people from rural areas and other societies “invaded” areas where housing was inexpensive. Those areas tended to be close to the places where they worked. In turn, people who could afford better housing and the cost of commuting “invaded” areas farther from the business district.

        [4] Park and Burgess’s model has come to be known as the “concentric-zone model” (represented by the figure). Because the model was originally based on studies of Chicago, its center is labeled “Loop,” the term commonly applied to that city’s central commercial zone. Surrounding the central zone is a “zone in transition,” an area that is being invaded by business and light manufacturing. The third zone is inhabited by workers who do not want to live in the factory or business district but at the same time need to live reasonably close to where they work. The fourth or residential zone consists of upscale apartment buildings and single-family homes. And the outermost ring, outside the city limits, is the suburban or commuters’ zone; its residents live within a 30- to 60-minute ride of the central business district.

        [4] Park and Burgess’s model has come to be known as the “concentric-zone model” (represented by the figure). Because the model was originally based on studies of Chicago, its center is labeled “Loop,” the term commonly applied to that city’s central commercial zone. Surrounding the central zone is a “zone in transition,” an area that is being invaded by business and light manufacturing. The third zone is inhabited by workers who do not want to live in the factory or business district but at the same time need to live reasonably close to where they work. The fourth or residential zone consists of upscale apartment buildings and single-family homes. And the outermost ring, outside the city limits, is the suburban or commuters’ zone; its residents live within a 30- to 60-minute ride of the central business district.

        [5] Studies by Park, Burgess, and other Chicago-school sociologists showed how new groups of immigrants tended to be concentrated in separate areas within inner-city zones, where they sometimes experienced tension with other ethnic groups that had arrived earlier. Over time, however, each group was able to adjust to life in the city and to find a place for itself in the urban economy. Eventually many of the immigrants moved to unsegregated areas in outer zones; the areas they left behind were promptly occupied by new waves of immigrants.

        [6] The Park and Burgess model of growth in zones and natural areas of the city can still be used to describe patterns of growth in cities that were built around a central business district and that continue to attract large numbers of immigrants. But this model is biased toward the commercial and industrial cities of North America, which have tended to form around business centers rather than around palaces or cathedrals, as is often the case in some other parts of the world. Moreover, it fails to account for other patterns of urbanization, such as the rapid urbanization that occurs along commercial transportation corridors and the rise of nearby satellite cities.

        passage: `In a vote that took place at the International Astronomical Union Conference on August 24th, 2006, Pluto lost its status as a planet in our solar system. Pluto was originally discovered in 1930 when scientists were searching for something that was interfering with Uranus's orbit. Though Pluto was estimated to be similar in size to Earth, it was later discovered that it was even smaller than our own moon, as well as many other moons.
        It is now known that there are thousands of planetary objects similar to Pluto, including Eris which is slightly larger than Pluto. Choosing to reclassify Pluto to a dwarf planet honors the fact that science is about making new discoveries. While it was a sad day for Pluto lovers, people in general have accepted the idea, and the next generation of children will grow up knowing only eight planets and thinking nothing of it. As Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, noted following the IUC's decision, "science is self-correcting."

You all will gain insights into the causes, major battles, and its profound impact on global politics. Here’s a question for the discussion board:<br/><strong> "How did World War II shape the post-war world order, and what lessons can we draw from this period to prevent future conflicts?"</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Kia:</strong></p>
            <p>World War II undeniably played a significant role in shaping the post-war world order for the better. In its aftermath, the establishment of the United Nations emerged as a beacon of hope for global cooperation and conflict resolution. Nations recognized the necessity of diplomacy over aggression, and the UN's formation paved the way for diplomatic dialogues and peaceful settlements. This emphasis on collaboration has led to a substantial decrease in major interstate conflicts since WWII, highlighting the positive impact it had on fostering a more stable and peaceful world.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Joe:</strong></p>
            <p>Conversely, World War II also left behind a legacy of distrust and geopolitical rivalries that continue to influence international relations negatively. The wartime alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union, for instance, quickly dissolved into the Cold War, characterized by proxy conflicts, nuclear arms race, and ideological tensions. This division of the world into opposing blocs led to decades of instability and conflict, illustrating how the aftermath of WWII sowed the seeds of future disputes. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of addressing underlying tensions and promoting diplomacy to prevent such prolonged periods of hostility in the future.</p>
