        [1] The means by which an art form presents its message is referred to as the medium. Thus, sound produced by instruments or human voices is the medium of music. Paint on canvas or paper is the medium of painting. For literature, the medium is written language. For theater, it is a story performed by actors on a stage.

        [2] Drama is sometimes seen as a branch of literature because plays, like literature, are often printed in book form. However, there is an important difference between the two forms. Unlike a novel, a play is written to be performed, and the script of a play is not a finished work; it is an outline for a performance. The physical production of the play—the scenery, lighting, and costumes—will affect the performance, and so will the actors. How the actors interpret their roles greatly influences the play's effect on the audience.

        [3] The basic encounter in theater is between the performers and the audience. This is a special type of encounter because the performers are playing other people, characters. Moreover, the characters are part of a human story that has been written by a dramatist. This combination of elements distinguishes theater from other art forms.

        [4] Theater has several other distinctive characteristics. First, the subject matter of theater is always human beings. Second, theater is universal—there is an impulse toward creating theater in all societies. Third, theater is transitory in nature—a play is an event that occurs through time. Finally, theater is set apart by its basic elements: audience, performers, director, dramatist, purpose, viewpoint, and setting.

        [5] Human beings and human concerns are always the subject matter of drama, even when the performers play animals, objects, or abstract ideas. In the medieval play Everyman, some of the roles are abstract ideas such as Beauty, Knowledge, and Strength. The central character is Everyman, a human character, and the subject is death arriving before we want it to come—a theme that is universal to humans. The focus of drama is on human beings, even though different human concerns have been emphasized in different plays.

        [6] In view of the human-centered quality of theater, it is not surprising that the impulse toward theater is universal. The urge to create drama has existed wherever human society has developed: in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. In every culture recorded in history or studied by anthropologists, we find rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations that include elements of theater. At various times, these ceremonies and stories developed into a separate realm of theater. In Greece, a fully developed theater emerged almost 2,500 years ago. In India, theater became well-established around 2,000 years ago. Wherever theater has become a separate art form, it has had certain essential qualities: a story—the play—is presented by one group—the performers—to another group—the audience.,

        [7] One special quality of a theater performance is its immediacy. In the theater, we live in the perpetual present tense. Theater is a transitory art. A performance changes from moment to moment, and each moment is a direct, immediate adventure for the audience. The transitory nature of theater is a quality it shares with music and dance, and it sets it apart from literature and the visual arts. A novel or a painting is a fixed object; it exists as a finished product. The performing arts, on the other hand, are not objects but events. Theater occurs through time; it is an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.

        passage: `
        [1] The means by which an art form presents its message is referred to as the medium. Thus, sound produced by instruments or human voices is the medium of music. Paint on canvas or paper is the medium of painting. For literature, the medium is written language. For theater, it is a story performed by actors on a stage.

        [2] Drama is sometimes seen as a branch of literature because plays, like literature, are often printed in book form. However, there is an important difference between the two forms. Unlike a novel, a play is written to be performed, and the script of a play is not a finished work; it is an outline for a performance. The physical production of the play—the scenery, lighting, and costumes—will affect the performance, and so will the actors. How the actors interpret their roles greatly influences the play's effect on the audience.

        [3] The basic encounter in theater is between the performers and the audience. This is a special type of encounter because the performers are playing other people, characters. Moreover, the characters are part of a human story that has been written by a dramatist. This combination of elements distinguishes theater from other art forms.

        [4] Theater has several other distinctive characteristics. First, the subject matter of theater is always human beings. Second, theater is universal—there is an impulse toward creating theater in all societies. Third, theater is transitory in nature—a play is an event that occurs through time. Finally, theater is set apart by its basic elements: audience, performers, director, dramatist, purpose, viewpoint, and setting.

        [5] Human beings and human concerns are always the subject matter of drama, even when the performers play animals, objects, or abstract ideas. In the medieval play Everyman, some of the roles are abstract ideas such as Beauty, Knowledge, and Strength. The central character is Everyman, a human character, and the subject is death arriving before we want it to come—a theme that is universal to humans. The focus of drama is on human beings, even though different human concerns have been emphasized in different plays.

        [6] In view of the human-centered quality of theater, it is not surprising that the impulse toward theater is universal. The urge to create drama has existed wherever human society has developed: in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. In every culture recorded in history or studied by anthropologists, we find rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations that include elements of theater. At various times, these ceremonies and stories developed into a separate realm of theater. In Greece, a fully developed theater emerged almost 2,500 years ago. In India, theater became well-established around 2,000 years ago. Wherever theater has become a separate art form, it has had certain essential qualities: a story—the play—is presented by one group—the performers—to another group—the audience.,

        [7] One special quality of a theater performance is its immediacy. In the theater, we live in the perpetual present tense. Theater is a transitory art. A performance changes from moment to moment, and each moment is a direct, immediate adventure for the audience. The transitory nature of theater is a quality it shares with music and dance, and it sets it apart from literature and the visual arts. A novel or a painting is a fixed object; it exists as a finished product. The performing arts, on the other hand, are not objects but events. Theater occurs through time; it is an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.

        passage: `
        [1] Indeed, the birth of aviation is inextricably linked to the astounding accomplishments of the Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who, through their innovative spirit, unrelenting perseverance, and meticulous attention to scientific methodology, ushered in an era of unprecedented technological progress. Born in Dayton, Ohio, these self-taught engineers were the progenitors of controlled, propelled flight, an achievement that irrefutably altered the course of human civilization and fostered a pervasive culture of exploration and progress.

        [2] The construction of the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel in 1901, which was used to meticulously collect empirical data on air pressure, lift, and drag on various airfoil shapes, was a linchpin of their pioneering voyage in aeronautics. This inventive device, the first of its kind, enabled them to comprehend the complexities of aerodynamics and refine their design concepts to a degree of precision previously unattainable. Through their meticulous research, they were able to dispel common misconceptions about air resistance and flight control, paving the way for the development of their groundbreaking aircraft.

        [3] In their pursuit of propelled flight, the implementation of their three-axis control system represents a monumental achievement. This mechanism, which incorporated roll, pitch, and yaw controls, was crucial to the development of their first successful aircraft, the Wright Flyer, and marked a decisive departure from the unsuccessful efforts of their contemporaries, who focused primarily on building powerful engines and wings without considering the nuances of control and stability. This innovative control system serves as the conceptual foundation for all current fixed-wing aircraft.

        [4] Although brief in duration, the Wright Brothers' historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, represented an extraordinary advance in human capability. Orville piloted the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, followed by Wilbur's mission, which lasted 59 seconds and covered 852 feet. Despite not being explicitly stated, it should be noted that these numbers represent considerably more than mere data. They represent the culmination of years of devoted research and experimentation, as well as the fulfillment of mankind's age-old desire to fly.

        [5] The Wright Brothers did not limit their contributions to aviation to the domain of technology and design alone. Their ardent advocacy for the commercial and military potential of aviation drove the eventual expansion and diversification of the industry. They envisioned a future in which air travel would revolutionize transportation, commerce, warfare, and communication, and they worked assiduously to persuade skeptics of the viability and efficacy of their vision. Although their advocacy efforts are frequently neglected, they were instrumental in establishing the aviation industry as it exists today.

        [6] The Wright Brothers fundamentally altered our perception of distance, time, and possibility through their revolutionary technological achievements and pioneering spirit. Nevertheless, they did so with a modesty and calm dignity that belied the magnitude of their achievements. In analyzing their invaluable contributions, we should endeavor to recall not only the innovation and tenacity they exhibited, but also the unwavering commitment, insatiable curiosity, and unwavering honesty with which they pursued their ambition. This synthesis of humanistic and technological excellence represents the Wright Brothers' true legacy.

        passage: `
        [1] Indeed, the birth of aviation is inextricably linked to the astounding accomplishments of the Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who, through their innovative spirit, unrelenting perseverance, and meticulous attention to scientific methodology, ushered in an era of unprecedented technological progress. Born in Dayton, Ohio, these self-taught engineers were the progenitors of controlled, propelled flight, an achievement that irrefutably altered the course of human civilization and fostered a pervasive culture of exploration and progress.

        [2] The construction of the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel in 1901, which was used to meticulously collect empirical data on air pressure, lift, and drag on various airfoil shapes, was a linchpin of their pioneering voyage in aeronautics. This inventive device, the first of its kind, enabled them to comprehend the complexities of aerodynamics and refine their design concepts to a degree of precision previously unattainable. Through their meticulous research, they were able to dispel common misconceptions about air resistance and flight control, paving the way for the development of their groundbreaking aircraft.

        [3] In their pursuit of propelled flight, the implementation of their three-axis control system represents a monumental achievement. This mechanism, which incorporated roll, pitch, and yaw controls, was crucial to the development of their first successful aircraft, the Wright Flyer, and marked a decisive departure from the unsuccessful efforts of their contemporaries, who focused primarily on building powerful engines and wings without considering the nuances of control and stability. This innovative control system serves as the conceptual foundation for all current fixed-wing aircraft.

        [4] Although brief in duration, the Wright Brothers' historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, represented an extraordinary advance in human capability. Orville piloted the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, followed by Wilbur's mission, which lasted 59 seconds and covered 852 feet. Despite not being explicitly stated, it should be noted that these numbers represent considerably more than mere data. They represent the culmination of years of devoted research and experimentation, as well as the fulfillment of mankind's age-old desire to fly.

        [5] The Wright Brothers did not limit their contributions to aviation to the domain of technology and design alone. Their ardent advocacy for the commercial and military potential of aviation drove the eventual expansion and diversification of the industry. They envisioned a future in which air travel would revolutionize transportation, commerce, warfare, and communication, and they worked assiduously to persuade skeptics of the viability and efficacy of their vision. Although their advocacy efforts are frequently neglected, they were instrumental in establishing the aviation industry as it exists today.

        [6] The Wright Brothers fundamentally altered our perception of distance, time, and possibility through their revolutionary technological achievements and pioneering spirit. Nevertheless, they did so with a modesty and calm dignity that belied the magnitude of their achievements. In analyzing their invaluable contributions, we should endeavor to recall not only the innovation and tenacity they exhibited, but also the unwavering commitment, insatiable curiosity, and unwavering honesty with which they pursued their ambition. This synthesis of humanistic and technological excellence represents the Wright Brothers' true legacy.

        passage: `
        Humans have always traveled across the earth. Early hunting-gathering nomads migrated in search of resources to sustain themselves. Later, after the spread of civilization, people of various religions made pilgrimages on foot or horseback, which led to the growth of wayside inns. Traders journeyed throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East in search of perfumes, spices and other goods. Vikings traveled across vast seas in search of fish, timber, and other natural resources. Europeans explored Africa and the Americas, conquering other civilizations and establishing colonies. These activities—religious pilgrimages, the growth of trade, conquest and colonization—all stimulated the growth of tourism.
        While the earliest “tourists” traveled in search of resources, later tourists took trips for cultural, educational, and scientific purposes. During the seventeenth century, the young members of Europe’s wealthy classes took “grand tours” through Europe to expand their cultural horizons, and to learn about languages, theater, music, and art. In the nineteenth century, naturalists like Charles Darwin studied animal and plant species in exotic places and contributed greatly to an interest in traveling for scientific advancement. In the early twentieth century, naturalist John Muir began to write about his wanderings through the southern United States, Alaska, and India, and his writings continue to inspire people to observe and preserve the natural world. Other travel heroes, such as Ernest Hemingway, wrote of their African expeditions to hunt big game, exposing people to the possibilities of journeying to faraway lands for adventure.

            <p>In next week’s class we’ll talk about different approaches to education. You know, not everyone agrees about the best way for young people to gain knowledge and learn new skills.  Let’s prepare by discussing whether it’s better for students to take classes with a lot of discussions or classes mainly focused on lectures. What do you think?</p>

            <p><strong>Jhonathan:</strong></p>
            <p>I prefer classes that have a lot of discussions. I just learn better when I’m actively engaged with academic material and can exchange ideas with my classmates. When I have the opportunity to get immediate feedback, I can understand things more deeply. I also benefit from hearing about different perspectives and new ways of thinking about challenging topics. Additionally, discussions help me retain the information better since they’re more interactive and memorable.</p>

            <p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
            <p>I see your point, Rachel, but I prefer lectures. I like being able to listen to an expert explain a topic and really get into it. With lectures, there’s usually a clear structure and a set agenda, which can help me stay focused and organized. I also appreciate being able to take notes and study at my own pace.  I can’t do those things if I have to engage in a discussion. Not only that, but discussions can sometimes get off track or become too argumentative, which can take away from the learning experience.</p>

        passage2: `Culture consists of the beliefs, values, rituals, texts, and symbols of a society. An important element of culture is the rules—or norms—that regulate behavior and maintain social order. Some norms tell us how we should behave—for example, obey authority and treat others with respect. Some norms are traditions or customs, such as clothing styles. Other norms cover matters of morality, such as courtship behavior or showing respect to ancestors. The most essential norms cover activities that are central to the well being of the whole society; these rules are established as laws, both written and unwritten.`,
