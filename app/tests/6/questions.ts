        [1] The means by which an art form presents its message is referred to as the medium. Thus, sound produced by instruments or human voices is the medium of music. Paint on canvas or paper is the medium of painting. For literature, the medium is written language. For theater, it is a story performed by actors on a stage.

        [2] Drama is sometimes seen as a branch of literature because plays, like literature, are often printed in book form. However, there is an important difference between the two forms. Unlike a novel, a play is written to be performed, and the script of a play is not a finished work; it is an outline for a performance. The physical production of the play—the scenery, lighting, and costumes—will affect the performance, and so will the actors. How the actors interpret their roles greatly influences the play's effect on the audience.

        [3] The basic encounter in theater is between the performers and the audience. This is a special type of encounter because the performers are playing other people, characters. Moreover, the characters are part of a human story that has been written by a dramatist. This combination of elements distinguishes theater from other art forms.

        [4] Theater has several other distinctive characteristics. First, the subject matter of theater is always human beings. Second, theater is universal—there is an impulse toward creating theater in all societies. Third, theater is transitory in nature—a play is an event that occurs through time. Finally, theater is set apart by its basic elements: audience, performers, director, dramatist, purpose, viewpoint, and setting.

        [5] Human beings and human concerns are always the subject matter of drama, even when the performers play animals, objects, or abstract ideas. In the medieval play Everyman, some of the roles are abstract ideas such as Beauty, Knowledge, and Strength. The central character is Everyman, a human character, and the subject is death arriving before we want it to come—a theme that is universal to humans. The focus of drama is on human beings, even though different human concerns have been emphasized in different plays.

        [6] In view of the human-centered quality of theater, it is not surprising that the impulse toward theater is universal. The urge to create drama has existed wherever human society has developed: in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. In every culture recorded in history or studied by anthropologists, we find rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations that include elements of theater. At various times, these ceremonies and stories developed into a separate realm of theater. In Greece, a fully developed theater emerged almost 2,500 years ago. In India, theater became well-established around 2,000 years ago. Wherever theater has become a separate art form, it has had certain essential qualities: a story—the play—is presented by one group—the performers—to another group—the audience.,

        [7] One special quality of a theater performance is its immediacy. In the theater, we live in the perpetual present tense. Theater is a transitory art. A performance changes from moment to moment, and each moment is a direct, immediate adventure for the audience. The transitory nature of theater is a quality it shares with music and dance, and it sets it apart from literature and the visual arts. A novel or a painting is a fixed object; it exists as a finished product. The performing arts, on the other hand, are not objects but events. Theater occurs through time; it is an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.

A novel or a painting is a fixed object; it exists as a finished product. The performing arts, on the other hand, are not objects but events. Theater occurs through time; it is an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.

        passage: `
        [1] The means by which an art form presents its message is referred to as the medium. Thus, sound produced by instruments or human voices is the medium of music. Paint on canvas or paper is the medium of painting. For literature, the medium is written language. For theater, it is a story performed by actors on a stage.

        [2] Drama is sometimes seen as a branch of literature because plays, like literature, are often printed in book form. However, there is an important difference between the two forms. Unlike a novel, a play is written to be performed, and the script of a play is not a finished work; it is an outline for a performance. The physical production of the play—the scenery, lighting, and costumes—will affect the performance, and so will the actors. How the actors interpret their roles greatly influences the play's effect on the audience.

        [3] The basic encounter in theater is between the performers and the audience. This is a special type of encounter because the performers are playing other people, characters. Moreover, the characters are part of a human story that has been written by a dramatist. This combination of elements distinguishes theater from other art forms.

        [4] Theater has several other distinctive characteristics. First, the subject matter of theater is always human beings. Second, theater is universal—there is an impulse toward creating theater in all societies. Third, theater is transitory in nature—a play is an event that occurs through time. Finally, theater is set apart by its basic elements: audience, performers, director, dramatist, purpose, viewpoint, and setting.

        [5] Human beings and human concerns are always the subject matter of drama, even when the performers play animals, objects, or abstract ideas. In the medieval play Everyman, some of the roles are abstract ideas such as Beauty, Knowledge, and Strength. The central character is Everyman, a human character, and the subject is death arriving before we want it to come—a theme that is universal to humans. The focus of drama is on human beings, even though different human concerns have been emphasized in different plays.

        [6] In view of the human-centered quality of theater, it is not surprising that the impulse toward theater is universal. ⬛[A] The urge to create drama has existed wherever human society has developed: in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. In every culture recorded in history or studied by anthropologists, we find rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations that include elements of theater. ⬛[B] At various times, these ceremonies and stories developed into a separate realm of theater. In Greece, a fully developed theater emerged almost 2,500 years ago. ⬛[C] In India, theater became well-established around 2,000 years ago. Wherever theater has become a separate art form, it has had certain essential qualities: a story—the play—is presented by one group—the performers—to another group—the audience.⬛[D]

        [7] One special quality of a theater performance is its immediacy. In the theater, we live in the perpetual present tense. Theater is a transitory art. A performance changes from moment to moment, and each moment is a direct, immediate adventure for the audience. The transitory nature of theater is a quality it shares with music and dance, and it sets it apart from literature and the visual arts. A novel or a painting is a fixed object; it exists as a finished product. The performing arts, on the other hand, are not objects but events. Theater occurs through time; it is an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.

        passage: `
        [1] Off the northeastern shore of North America, from the island of Newfoundland in Canada south to New England in the United States, there is a series of shallow areas called banks. Several large banks off Newfoundland are together called the Grand Banks, huge shoals on the edge of the North American continental shelf, where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream meet the cold waters of the Labrador Current. As the currents brush each other, they stir up minerals from the ocean floor, providing nutrients for plankton and tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill, which feed on the plankton. Herring and other small fish rise to the surface to eat the krill. Groundfish, such as cod and Atlantic cod, live on the bottom layer, congregating in the shallow waters where they prey on krill and small fish. This rich environment has produced cod by the millions and once had a greater density of cod than anywhere else on Earth.

        [2] Beginning in the eleventh century, boats from the ports of northwestern Europe arrived to fish the Grand Banks. For the next eight centuries, the entire Newfoundland economy was based on Europeans arriving, catching fish for a few months in the summer, and then taking fish back to European markets. Cod laid out to dry on wooden "flakes" was a common sight in the fishing villages dotting the coast. Settlers in the region used to think the only sea creature worth talking about was cod, and in the local speech the word "fish" became synonymous with cod. Newfoundland’s national dish was a pudding whose main ingredient was cod.

        [3] By the nineteenth century, the Newfoundland fishery was largely controlled by merchants based in the capital at St. John’s. They marketed the catch supplied by the fishers working out of more than 600 villages around the long coastline. In return, the merchants provided fishing equipment, clothing, and all the food that could not be grown in the island’s thin, rocky soil. This system kept the fishers in a continuous state of debt and dependence on the merchants.

        [4] Until the twentieth century, fishers believed in the cod’s ability to replenish itself and thought that overfishing was impossible. However, Newfoundland’s cod fishery began to show signs of trouble during the 1930s, when cod failed to support the fishers and thousands were unemployed. The slump lasted for the next few decades. Then, when an international agreement in 1977 established the 200-mile offshore fishing limit, the Canadian government decided to build up the modern Grand Banks fleet and make fishing a viable economic base for Newfoundland again. All of Newfoundland’s seafood companies were merged into one conglomerate. By the 1980s, the conglomerate was prospering, and cod were commanding excellent prices in the market. Consequently, there was a significant increase in the number of fishers and fish-processing plant workers.

        [5] However, while the offshore fishery was prospering, the inshore fishermen found their catches dropping off. In 1992 the Canadian government responded by closing the Grand Banks to groundfishing. Newfoundland’s cod fishing and processing industries were shut down in a bid to let the vanishing stocks recover. The moratorium was extended in 1994, when all of the Atlantic cod fisheries in Canada were closed, except for one in Nova Scotia, and strict quotas were placed on other species of groundfish. Canada’s cod fishing industry collapsed, and around 40,000 fishers and other industry workers were put out of work.

        [6] Atlantic cod stocks had once been so plentiful that early explorers joked about walking on the backs of the teeming fish. Today, cod stocks are at historically low levels and show no signs of imminent recovery, even after drastic conservation measures and severely limited fishing. Fishermen often blame the diminishing stocks on seals, which prey on cod and other species, but scientists believe that decades of overfishing are to blame. Studies on fish populations have shown that cod disappeared from Newfoundland at the same time that stocks started rebuilding in Norway, raising the possibility that the cod had migrated. Still, no one can predict whether and when the cod will return to the Grand Banks.

        passage: `
        [1] Off the northeastern shore of North America, from the island of Newfoundland in Canada south to New England in the United States, there is a series of shallow areas called banks. Several large banks off Newfoundland are together called the Grand Banks, huge shoals on the edge of the North American continental shelf, where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream meet the cold waters of the Labrador Current. As the currents brush each other, they stir up minerals from the ocean floor, providing nutrients for plankton and tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill, which feed on the plankton. Herring and other small fish rise to the surface to eat the krill. Groundfish, such as cod and Atlantic cod, live on the bottom layer, congregating in the shallow waters where they prey on krill and small fish. This rich environment has produced cod by the millions and once had a greater density of cod than anywhere else on Earth.

        [2] Beginning in the eleventh century, boats from the ports of northwestern Europe arrived to fish the Grand Banks. For the next eight centuries, the entire Newfoundland economy was based on Europeans arriving, catching fish for a few months in the summer, and then taking fish back to European markets. Cod laid out to dry on wooden "flakes" was a common sight in the fishing villages dotting the coast. Settlers in the region used to think the only sea creature worth talking about was cod, and in the local speech the word "fish" became synonymous with cod. Newfoundland’s national dish was a pudding whose main ingredient was cod.

        [3] By the nineteenth century, the Newfoundland fishery was largely controlled by merchants based in the capital at St. John’s. They marketed the catch supplied by the fishers working out of more than 600 villages around the long coastline. In return, the merchants provided fishing equipment, clothing, and all the food that could not be grown in the island’s thin, rocky soil. This system kept the fishers in a continuous state of debt and dependence on the merchants.

        [4] Until the twentieth century, fishers believed in the cod’s ability to replenish itself and thought that overfishing was impossible. However, Newfoundland’s cod fishery began to show signs of trouble during the 1930s, when cod failed to support the fishers and thousands were unemployed. The slump lasted for the next few decades. Then, when an international agreement in 1977 established the 200-mile offshore fishing limit, the Canadian government decided to build up the modern Grand Banks fleet and make fishing a viable economic base for Newfoundland again. All of Newfoundland’s seafood companies were merged into one conglomerate. By the 1980s, the conglomerate was prospering, and cod were commanding excellent prices in the market. Consequently, there was a significant increase in the number of fishers and fish-processing plant workers.

        [5] However, while the offshore fishery was prospering, the inshore fishermen found their catches dropping off. In 1992 the Canadian government responded by closing the Grand Banks to groundfishing. Newfoundland’s cod fishing and processing industries were shut down in a bid to let the vanishing stocks recover. The moratorium was extended in 1994, when all of the Atlantic cod fisheries in Canada were closed, except for one in Nova Scotia, and strict quotas were placed on other species of groundfish. Canada’s cod fishing industry collapsed, and around 40,000 fishers and other industry workers were put out of work.

        passage: `
        Humans have always traveled across the earth. Early hunting-gathering nomads migrated in search of resources to sustain themselves. Later, after the spread of civilization, people of various religions made pilgrimages on foot or horseback, which led to the growth of wayside inns. Traders journeyed throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East in search of perfumes, spices and other goods. Vikings traveled across vast seas in search of fish, timber, and other natural resources. Europeans explored Africa and the Americas, conquering other civilizations and establishing colonies. These activities—religious pilgrimages, the growth of trade, conquest and colonization—all stimulated the growth of tourism.
        While the earliest “tourists” traveled in search of resources, later tourists took trips for cultural, educational, and scientific purposes. During the seventeenth century, the young members of Europe’s wealthy classes took “grand tours” through Europe to expand their cultural horizons, and to learn about languages, theater, music, and art. In the nineteenth century, naturalists like Charles Darwin studied animal and plant species in exotic places and contributed greatly to an interest in traveling for scientific advancement. In the early twentieth century, naturalist John Muir began to write about his wanderings through the southern United States, Alaska, and India, and his writings continue to inspire people to observe and preserve the natural world. Other travel heroes, such as Ernest Hemingway, wrote of their African expeditions to hunt big game, exposing people to the possibilities of journeying to faraway lands for adventure.

            <p>In next week’s class we’ll talk about different approaches to education. You know, not everyone agrees about the best way for young people to gain knowledge and learn new skills.  Let’s prepare by discussing whether it’s better for students to take classes with a lot of discussions or classes mainly focused on lectures. What do you think?</p>

            <p><strong>Jhonathan:</strong></p>
            <p>I prefer classes that have a lot of discussions. I just learn better when I’m actively engaged with academic material and can exchange ideas with my classmates. When I have the opportunity to get immediate feedback, I can understand things more deeply. I also benefit from hearing about different perspectives and new ways of thinking about challenging topics. Additionally, discussions help me retain the information better since they’re more interactive and memorable.</p>

        <div>
            <p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
            <p>I see your point, Rachel, but I prefer lectures. I like being able to listen to an expert explain a topic and really get into it. With lectures, there’s usually a clear structure and a set agenda, which can help me stay focused and organized. I also appreciate being able to take notes and study at my own pace.  I can’t do those things if I have to engage in a discussion. Not only that, but discussions can sometimes get off track or become too argumentative, which can take away from the learning experience.</p>

        passage2: `Culture consists of the beliefs, values, rituals, texts, and symbols of a society. An important element of culture is the rules—or norms—that regulate behavior and maintain social order. Some norms tell us how we should behave—for example, obey authority and treat others with respect. Some norms are traditions or customs, such as clothing styles. Other norms cover matters of morality, such as courtship behavior or showing respect to ancestors. The most essential norms cover activities that are central to the well being of the whole society; these rules are established as laws, both written and unwritten.`,
