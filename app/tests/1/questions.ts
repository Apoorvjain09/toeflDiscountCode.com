        passage: `
        [1] The Baroque era, which lasted from the late 16th to the middle of the 18th century, is an intriguing era in the history of the arts, marked by grandeur, drama, and extravagance. Baroque art, which originated in Rome and ultimately spread throughout Europe, encapsulated the cultural, intellectual, and spiritual zeitgeist of its time, influencing everything from architecture to music to painting to sculpture. In essence, the Baroque style aimed to evoke an emotional response by employing a vast array of techniques and instruments to create a sense of motion, tension, and grandeur.

        [2] Within the expansive influence of the Baroque, the domain of painting gained prominence, its evolution characterized by three primary elements. The technique of chiaroscuro, which emphasized the contrast between light and dark, was popularized by Caravaggio and refined by subsequent artists such as Rembrandt and Vermeer. Alongside this, tenebrism, an exaggerated form of chiaroscuro that emphasizes deep, often opaque shadows, was used to create intense, mood-driven works of art. Lastly, the staging of dramatic sequences, which were frequently biblical or mythological in nature, served to enhance the emotional resonance of Baroque art.

        [3] In keeping with the period's general philosophy, Baroque architecture adopted an aesthetic of grandeur and ornate embellishment. Period structures are distinguished by their intricate facades, expansive spaces, and intricate floor plans. The construction of cathedrals, palaces, and other civic structures became physical manifestations of power and prestige. St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and the Palace of Versailles in France are notable examples. However, it is essential to note that the ostentatious features did not merely serve an aesthetic function; they were frequently employed as a Counter-Reformation tool, demonstrating the Church’s affluence and power in response to the expanding Protestant threat.

        [4] In keeping with the period's dramatic artistic sensibility, Baroque music marked a distinct departure from the relatively simple and measured rhythms and melodies of the Renaissance. Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel introduced ornate musical lines, emotional melodies, and intricate contrapuntal textures. The development of the tonal system, which replaced the Renaissance's modal system, permitted more harmonic possibilities, thereby expanding the affective pallet of compositions. In addition, opera, a synthesis of music, drama, and visual arts, was created during the Baroque period, exemplifying the Baroque’s pursuit of emotional expression.

        [5] Midway through the eighteenth century, the transition to the Enlightenment marked a significant shift in societal values and perceptions, which inevitably influenced the development of the arts. In contrast to the Baroque period’s emphasis on extravagance, drama, and emotional profundity, the Enlightenment emphasized reason, equilibrium, and restraint. It is crucial to recognize the continuity of these periods without reducing them to a dichotomy between sentiment and reason. Complex and diverse as they were, the artistic contributions of the Baroque period lay a solid foundation that would be reevaluated and expanded upon in subsequent periods.

        [6] The Baroque era has left an indelible impression on the artistic world, its influences resonating throughout the centuries. The advancements in style and technique, the exploratory spirit, and the sociocultural resonance of the Baroque period remain ingrained in the collective cultural consciousness.

        passage: `
        [1] The Baroque era, which lasted from the late 16th to the middle of the 18th century, is an intriguing era in the history of the arts, marked by grandeur, drama, and extravagance. Baroque art, which originated in Rome and ultimately spread throughout Europe, encapsulated the cultural, intellectual, and spiritual zeitgeist of its time, influencing everything from architecture to music to painting to sculpture. In essence, the Baroque style aimed to evoke an emotional response by employing a vast array of techniques and instruments to create a sense of motion, tension, and grandeur.

        [2] Within the expansive influence of the Baroque, the domain of painting gained prominence, its evolution characterized by three primary elements. The technique of chiaroscuro, which emphasized the contrast between light and dark, was popularized by Caravaggio and refined by subsequent artists such as Rembrandt and Vermeer. Alongside this, tenebrism, an exaggerated form of chiaroscuro that emphasizes deep, often opaque shadows, was used to create intense, mood-driven works of art. Lastly, the staging of dramatic sequences, which were frequently biblical or mythological in nature, served to enhance the emotional resonance of Baroque art.

        [3] In keeping with the period's general philosophy, Baroque architecture adopted an aesthetic of grandeur and ornate embellishment. Period structures are distinguished by their intricate facades, expansive spaces, and intricate floor plans. The construction of cathedrals, palaces, and other civic structures became physical manifestations of power and prestige. St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and the Palace of Versailles in France are notable examples. However, it is essential to note that the ostentatious features did not merely serve an aesthetic function; they were frequently employed as a Counter-Reformation tool, demonstrating the Church’s affluence and power in response to the expanding Protestant threat.

        [4] In keeping with the period's dramatic artistic sensibility, Baroque music marked a distinct departure from the relatively simple and measured rhythms and melodies of the Renaissance. Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel introduced ornate musical lines, emotional melodies, and intricate contrapuntal textures. The development of the tonal system, which replaced the Renaissance's modal system, permitted more harmonic possibilities, thereby expanding the affective pallet of compositions. In addition, opera, a synthesis of music, drama, and visual arts, was created during the Baroque period, exemplifying the Baroque’s pursuit of emotional expression.

        [5] Midway through the eighteenth century, the transition to the Enlightenment marked a significant shift in societal values and perceptions, which inevitably influenced the development of the arts. In contrast to the Baroque period’s emphasis on extravagance, drama, and emotional profundity, the Enlightenment emphasized reason, equilibrium, and restraint.

        passage: `
        [1] Indeed, the birth of aviation is inextricably linked to the astounding accomplishments of the Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who, through their innovative spirit, unrelenting perseverance, and meticulous attention to scientific methodology, ushered in an era of unprecedented technological progress. Born in Dayton, Ohio, these self-taught engineers were the progenitors of controlled, propelled flight, an achievement that irrefutably altered the course of human civilization and fostered a pervasive culture of exploration and progress.

        [2] The construction of the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel in 1901, which was used to meticulously collect empirical data on air pressure, lift, and drag on various airfoil shapes, was a linchpin of their pioneering voyage in aeronautics. This inventive device, the first of its kind, enabled them to comprehend the complexities of aerodynamics and refine their design concepts to a degree of precision previously unattainable. Through their meticulous research, they were able to dispel common misconceptions about air resistance and flight control, paving the way for the development of their groundbreaking aircraft.

        [3] In their pursuit of propelled flight, the implementation of their three-axis control system represents a monumental achievement. This mechanism, which incorporated roll, pitch, and yaw controls, was crucial to the development of their first successful aircraft, the Wright Flyer, and marked a decisive departure from the unsuccessful efforts of their contemporaries, who focused primarily on building powerful engines and wings without considering the nuances of control and stability. This innovative control system serves as the conceptual foundation for all current fixed-wing aircraft.

        [4] Although brief in duration, the Wright Brothers' historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, represented an extraordinary advance in human capability. Orville piloted the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, followed by Wilbur's mission, which lasted 59 seconds and covered 852 feet. Despite not being explicitly stated, it should be noted that these numbers represent considerably more than mere data. They represent the culmination of years of devoted research and experimentation, as well as the fulfillment of mankind's age-old desire to fly.

        [5] The Wright Brothers did not limit their contributions to aviation to the domain of technology and design alone. Their ardent advocacy for the commercial and military potential of aviation drove the eventual expansion and diversification of the industry. They envisioned a future in which air travel would revolutionize transportation, commerce, warfare, and communication, and they worked assiduously to persuade skeptics of the viability and efficacy of their vision. Although their advocacy efforts are frequently neglected, they were instrumental in establishing the aviation industry as it exists today.

        [6] The Wright Brothers fundamentally altered our perception of distance, time, and possibility through their revolutionary technological achievements and pioneering spirit. Nevertheless, they did so with a modesty and calm dignity that belied the magnitude of their achievements. In analyzing their invaluable contributions, we should endeavor to recall not only the innovation and tenacity they exhibited, but also the unwavering commitment, insatiable curiosity, and unwavering honesty with which they pursued their ambition. This synthesis of humanistic and technological excellence represents the Wright Brothers' true legacy.

        [1] Indeed, the birth of aviation is inextricably linked to the astounding accomplishments of the Wright Brothers, Orville and Wilbur, who, through their innovative spirit, unrelenting perseverance, and meticulous attention to scientific methodology, ushered in an era of unprecedented technological progress. Born in Dayton, Ohio, these self-taught engineers were the progenitors of controlled, propelled flight, an achievement that irrefutably altered the course of human civilization and fostered a pervasive culture of exploration and progress.

        [2] The construction of the Wright Brothers' wind tunnel in 1901, which was used to meticulously collect empirical data on air pressure, lift, and drag on various airfoil shapes, was a linchpin of their pioneering voyage in aeronautics. This inventive device, the first of its kind, enabled them to comprehend the complexities of aerodynamics and refine their design concepts to a degree of precision previously unattainable. Through their meticulous research, they were able to dispel common misconceptions about air resistance and flight control, paving the way for the development of their groundbreaking aircraft.

        [3] In their pursuit of propelled flight, the implementation of their three-axis control system represents a monumental achievement. This mechanism, which incorporated roll, pitch, and yaw controls, was crucial to the development of their first successful aircraft, the Wright Flyer, and marked a decisive departure from the unsuccessful efforts of their contemporaries, who focused primarily on building powerful engines and wings without considering the nuances of control and stability. This innovative control system serves as the conceptual foundation for all current fixed-wing aircraft.

        [4] Although brief in duration, the Wright Brothers' historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, represented an extraordinary advance in human capability. Orville piloted the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, followed by Wilbur's mission, which lasted 59 seconds and covered 852 feet. Despite not being explicitly stated, it should be noted that these numbers represent considerably more than mere data. They represent the culmination of years of devoted research and experimentation, as well as the fulfillment of mankind's age-old desire to fly.

        [5] The Wright Brothers did not limit their contributions to aviation to the domain of technology and design alone. Their ardent advocacy for the commercial and military potential of aviation drove the eventual expansion and diversification of the industry. They envisioned a future in which air travel would revolutionize transportation, commerce, warfare, and communication, and they worked assiduously to persuade skeptics of the viability and efficacy of their vision. Although their advocacy efforts are frequently neglected, they were instrumental in establishing the aviation industry as it exists today.

        [6] The Wright Brothers fundamentally altered our perception of distance, time, and possibility through their revolutionary technological achievements and pioneering spirit. Nevertheless, they did so with a modesty and calm dignity that belied the magnitude of their achievements. In analyzing their invaluable contributions, we should endeavor to recall not only the innovation and tenacity they exhibited, but also the unwavering commitment, insatiable curiosity, and unwavering honesty with which they pursued their ambition. This synthesis of humanistic and technological excellence represents the Wright Brothers' true legacy.

        passage: `
        Humans have always traveled across the earth. Early hunting-gathering nomads migrated in search of resources to sustain themselves. Later, after the spread of civilization, people of various religions made pilgrimages on foot or horseback, which led to the growth of wayside inns. Traders journeyed throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East in search of perfumes, spices and other goods. Vikings traveled across vast seas in search of fish, timber, and other natural resources. Europeans explored Africa and the Americas, conquering other civilizations and establishing colonies. These activities—religious pilgrimages, the growth of trade, conquest and colonization—all stimulated the growth of tourism.
        While the earliest “tourists” traveled in search of resources, later tourists took trips for cultural, educational, and scientific purposes. During the seventeenth century, the young members of Europe’s wealthy classes took “grand tours” through Europe to expand their cultural horizons, and to learn about languages, theater, music, and art. In the nineteenth century, naturalists like Charles Darwin studied animal and plant species in exotic places and contributed greatly to an interest in traveling for scientific advancement. In the early twentieth century, naturalist John Muir began to write about his wanderings through the southern United States, Alaska, and India, and his writings continue to inspire people to observe and preserve the natural world. Other travel heroes, such as Ernest Hemingway, wrote of their African expeditions to hunt big game, exposing people to the possibilities of journeying to faraway lands for adventure.

            <p>In next week’s class we’ll talk about different approaches to education. You know, not everyone agrees about the best way for young people to gain knowledge and learn new skills.  Let’s prepare by discussing whether it’s better for students to take classes with a lot of discussions or classes mainly focused on lectures. What do you think?</p>

            <p><strong>Jhonathan:</strong></p>
            <p>I prefer classes that have a lot of discussions. I just learn better when I’m actively engaged with academic material and can exchange ideas with my classmates. When I have the opportunity to get immediate feedback, I can understand things more deeply. I also benefit from hearing about different perspectives and new ways of thinking about challenging topics. Additionally, discussions help me retain the information better since they’re more interactive and memorable.</p>

            <p><strong>Mike:</strong></p>
            <p>I see your point, Rachel, but I prefer lectures. I like being able to listen to an expert explain a topic and really get into it. With lectures, there’s usually a clear structure and a set agenda, which can help me stay focused and organized. I also appreciate being able to take notes and study at my own pace.  I can’t do those things if I have to engage in a discussion. Not only that, but discussions can sometimes get off track or become too argumentative, which can take away from the learning experience.</p>

        passage2: `Culture consists of the beliefs, values, rituals, texts, and symbols of a society. An important element of culture is the rules—or norms—that regulate behavior and maintain social order. Some norms tell us how we should behave—for example, obey authority and treat others with respect. Some norms are traditions or customs, such as clothing styles. Other norms cover matters of morality, such as courtship behavior or showing respect to ancestors. The most essential norms cover activities that are central to the well being of the whole society; these rules are established as laws, both written and unwritten.`,
